# Automation Project with PyAutoGui

This project leverages PyAutoGui to automate tasks within the graphical user interface (GUI). The scripts included perform actions such as locating an image on the screen and categorizing colors in a specific region.

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python installed in your environment. Additionally, install the necessary libraries by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- **main_script.py**: This script serves as the primary entry point for initiating the automation.

- **colors.py**: Module containing essential functions for color classification in the project.

- **images/**: Folder storing images used during the automation.

- **requirements.txt**: File outlining project dependencies. You can install them using the aforementioned command.

Make sure to follow these steps to have a prepared environment before running any scripts in the project. This approach streamlines dependency management and ensures smooth automation execution.
